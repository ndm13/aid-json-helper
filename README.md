# AI Dungeon JSON Helper

Built using [create-vite-extra](https://github.com/bluwy/create-vite-extra/tree/master/template-deno-svelte-ts)'s
Deno/Svelte template.

This project is just a quick way to handle the JSON files generated by [AI Dungeon](https://www.aidungeon.com/).
Currently, it supports story card exports.  These files can be edited in your browser using pure client-side JavaScript:
no data gets sent to any servers, so feel free to use this on any content you want.  If you're really paranoid, you can
download and run it yourself by cloning this repository and installing Deno.  If there's expressed interest, I may also
provide something pre-built, but you could also download the files that are hosted live and use those directly.

## Running

You need to have Deno v1.28.0 or later installed to run this repo.

Start a dev server:

```
$ deno task dev
```

## Deploy
